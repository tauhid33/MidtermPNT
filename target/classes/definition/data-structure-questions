Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Data structure is used to store multiple values in same Object

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Create, Destroy, Traversal accessing a particular data, Updating, Insertion, Replace

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Numerical Analysis, Operating System, Compiler Design, Database Management System, Graphics, Statistical Analysis, Machine
Learning.

what is an Array?
Array is an object that contains multiple values.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is static and has to be predefined. ArrayList is dynamic where it grows dynamically based on need.
ArrayList can have multiple datatypes, multiple operations and also its easier to use than Array.

what is LinkedList?
Defined in nodes (nodes address / pointers) is a node used to store the values.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Linked List stores values in nodes.
ArrayList stores values in a block.
Linked List is faster and easier to use.

what is queue?
Queue is collecting the way the data is stored. First in last out and Last In First Out.

what is stack?
Stack is a data structure that extends the vector class. Last In First Out, First In Last Out.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
First in First Out and Last In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?

Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes depending on the amount of input data.
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²).

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Best case is to use the Map, ArrayList and also Set to search and element from an array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst case to search an element from an array is by using the ArrayList.

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that
each node of the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”).

what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable is synchronized and HashMap is not synchronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS = Array
Network data model = Graph
Hierarchical data model = Trees

How HashMap works in java?
By using the Key Value pair

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
This exception gets thrown if the index number tries to access an array index that is greater than or equal to the length of
the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
By using the Object.Clone() and Array.CopyOf()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements
of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers. Array elements can be accessed
randomly using the array index. Random accessing is not possible in linked lists.

What is DFS and BFS?
BFS is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures.
DFS is an algorithm for finding or traversing graphs or trees in depth-ward direction.

What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a method calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear datas are stored in a linear way i.e. ArrayList, Set and Linked List
Non Linear are Graphs and Trees.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run. It's how we compare the
efficiency of different approaches to a problem.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Bubble Sort: This sorting technique involves the comparison of two adjacent elements of the vector.
If we are sorting in ascending order then the one which turns out to be greater among the two is pushed towards
the right and the smaller element is pushed towards the left.

Selection Sort: In this method of sorting we select one element from the vector at a time, compare
it with all the other elements, and decide the correct position of this particular element in the vector.

Insertion Sort: It is very similar to sorting cards. Divide the vector into two parts, one sorted and the other one
unsorted. Now, we insert cards(elements) from the unsorted part into the sorted part at their correct position.
This method is also quadratic with N.


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.

  Data structure	Access	Search	Insertion	Removing
  Array	O(1)	O(N)	O(N)	O(N)
  Stack	O(N)	O(N)	O(1)	O(1)
  Queue	O(N)	O(N)	O(1)	O(1)
  Singly Linked list	O(N)	O(N)	O(1)	O(1)
  Doubly Linked List	O(N)	O(N)	O(1)	O(1)
  Hash Table	O(1)	O(1)	O(1)	O(1)
  Binary Search Tree	O(log N)	O(log N)	O(log N)	O(log N)
